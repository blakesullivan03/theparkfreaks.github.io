                    Since we’re still in the beginning stages of our podcast we don’t have a set release schedule for our
                    episodes yet. However, we do know that our episodes  will be released on YouTube. If there are any topics you’d 
                    like to see us talk about feel free to message us on instagram at @theparkfreakspodcast.
